This is the assignment, If you have not been studying You will cause trouble to your team because everything in here should’ve been covered in at least the first sections of freecodecamp. Please read carefully, only ask after you’ve read and discussed with your team and something is totally unclear. 

Each team will create a beautiful looking web page that contains the following information of a certain company, it can be any company it’s up to you. 

It will have 3 linked pages 
•⁠  ⁠Home page 
•⁠  ⁠⁠Projects page
•⁠  ⁠⁠About page 

Each page will have a header that has 3 links horizontal menu that when clicked it takes you to one of those pages meaning there should be a link to projects html page, to about page and I should be able to click back to home page. 

Home Page 

In addition to the header, The Home page should have a large middle section with preferably a beautiful  image, further down the page should have section where your services are listed in a nice and beautiful way. Then it should also have a call to action like a contact us button, then further down the page should also have a footer. 


Projects Page 

The projects page is different from home page and should be accessible when you at a path like this /projects.html 

It include the header similar to home page, it should list down in a more creative and beautiful way at list 5 projects your company has done in the past. 

About Page 

It should also contain the header similar to other pages, it should be accessible here /about.html 

It should contain information about your company, bonus points if you put pictures of team members in your group and their details. 

Now all the above should be done just in HTML and CSS. 

Here comes the little JavaScript part. 

•⁠  ⁠On the home page, Put a clock somewhere that shows today’s date and time properly formatted 
•⁠  ⁠⁠a button beautifully placed somewhere on this page that when clicked it changes the background color of the whole page, Please note that the colors should be nice colors that make it easy to read the text. Don’t blue colors like red when the text is black. 


How to submit. 

Every team needs to host their projects preferably on GitHub, ine I also need to see the link, each team has someone who knows how to do this so please collaborate and teach other on this. 

Each person should contribute, this means that I will be checking the commits of every team’s project to see who contributed and how often they did that this is to make sure that it’s not just one person who did it everyone while everyone else in the team was sleeping. 

The GitHub repository needs to be public, it should be named in small letters, no space(if needed use -) 

Submission is Sunday the 22nd of September, 2024.
